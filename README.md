# StruggleBus

Back End Capstone: StruggleBus (working Title)

Basic Premise:

We all struggle from time to time (or all the time), but in our ‘bootstrap’ oriented society it can be very challenging to ask for help when you need it. StruggleBus gives users a path of least resistance for reaching out to those who care about them most




## Tools used:
- Google Firebase - user authentication
- Twilio - SMS api
- React Bootstrap
- React-Router-Dom


## Languages:
- Front End: Javascript with react
- Back End: C# & SQL 

## MVP:
- Users can sign in and set their number and the number of a support contact
- User can customize their help messages, but default messages are available
- Only the user can set & see their information


## Stretch Goals:
- Add a second tier to messages
    1 - standard help message
    2 - danger: user needs immediate assistance
- Admin account functionality
    User permissions
- A user can have multiple accountability buddies
- friend functionality to allow users to support each other
